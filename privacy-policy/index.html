			<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We, the Operators of this Website (site) (iocage), provide it as a public service to our users.</p>
			<p>Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized online experience that provides you with the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. This Privacy Policy has been written to describe the conditions under which this web site is being made available to you. The Privacy Policy discusses, among other things, how data obtained during your visit to this web site may be collected and used. We strongly recommend that you read the Privacy Policy carefully. By using this web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>The process of maintaining a web site is an evolving one, and the Operators may decide at some point in the future, without advance notice, to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your use of the web site, or materials obtained from the web site, indicates your assent to the Privacy Policy at the time of such use. The effective Privacy Policy will be posted on the web site, and you should check upon every visit for any changes.</p>
			<h3 id="sites-covered-by-this-privacy-policy">Sites Covered by this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all the Operators-maintained web sites, domains, information portals, and registries including iocage.io.</p>
			<h3 id="links-to-non-operators-web-sites">Links to Non-Operators Web Sites</h3>
			<p>iocage.io may provide links to third-party web sites for the convenience of our users. If you access those links, you will leave the Operator&rsquo;s web site. The Operators do not control these third-party websites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, other web sites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from that described in this document. Therefore, you should use other web sites with caution, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any web site before submitting personal information.</p>
			<h2 id="types-of-information-we-collect">Types of Information We Collect</h2>
			<h3 id="non-personal-information">Non-Personal Information</h3>
			<p>Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. The Operators may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use the Operator&rsquo;s web sites.</p>
			<h3 id="aggregate-information">Aggregate Information</h3>
			<p>The Operators may gather aggregate information, which refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.</p>
			<h3 id="log-files">Log Files</h3>
			<p>Every time you request or are referred to acquire the source from iocage.io or any linked sites, the Operators may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. The Operators may use this information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes.</p>
			<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
			<p>Our site may use a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a web site’s computer stores on your computer. The Operators web sites can then read the cookies whenever you visit our site. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, to deliver content specific to your interests and to track the pages you’ve visited. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to customize your experience so that your visit to our site is as relevant and as valuable to you as possible.</p>
			<p>Most browser software can be set up to deal with cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our web site may not work properly, and you may be unable to use those of the Operator&rsquo;s services that require registration in order to participate, or you will have to re-register each time you visit our site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.</p>
			<h3 id="web-beacons">Web Beacons</h3>
			<p>The Operator&rsquo;s web site also may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of our web site and the web sites of selected sponsors or members, your use of special promotions or newsletters, and other activities. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our web site and selected sponsors’ sites, how many people open our emails, and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our web site or those of our sponsors. The Operators do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission.</p>
			<h3 id="personal-information">Personal Information</h3>
			<p>Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. The Operators use personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. On some of the Operators web pages, you may be able to request information, subscribe to mailing lists, participate in online discussions, collaborate on documents, provide feedback, submit information into registries, register for events, apply for membership, or join technical committees or working groups. The types of personal information you may provide to us on these pages may include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs, and passwords.</p>
			<h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Information</h2>
			<p>The Operators may use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about the Operator&rsquo;s web site usability, performance, and effectiveness. It may be used to improve the experience, usability, and content of the site.</p>
			<p>The Operators may use personal information to provide services that support the activities of the Operator&rsquo;s members and their collaboration on the Operator&rsquo;s standards and projects. When accessing the Operator&rsquo;s members-only web pages, your personal user information may be tracked by the Operators in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication between members.</p>
			<h3 id="information-sharing">Information Sharing</h3>
			<p>The Operators do not sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information. However, the Operators reserve the right to supply any such information to any organization into which the Operators may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of its mission. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our Terms of Use or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, the Operators may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders.</p>
			<p>In keeping with our open process, the Operators may maintain publicly accessible archives for the majority of our activities. For example, posting an email to any of the Operator&rsquo;s-hosted public mail lists or discussion forums, subscribing to one of our newsletters or registering for one of our public meetings may result in your email address becoming part of the publicly accessible archives.</p>
			<p>On some sites, anonymous users are allowed to post content and/or participate in forum discussions. In such a case, since no user name can be associated with such a user, the IP address number of a user is used as an identifier. When posting content or messages to a Operator&rsquo;s site anonymously, your IP address may be revealed to the public.</p>
			<p>If you are a registered member of an Operator&rsquo;s website or email list, the Operator’s member databases may retain information about your name, email address, company affiliation, and such other personal address and identifying data as you choose to supply.
			Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose in public areas of our web site and off-site community areas, such as forums, message boards, and news groups, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these.</p>
			<p>Given the international scope of the Operator’s websites, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 (“EU Privacy Directive”) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, individuals located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to its transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America.</p>
			<p>If you do not want your personal information collected and used by the Operators, please do not visit the Operator&rsquo;s web site or apply for membership of any of the Operator’s websites or email lists.</p>
			<h3 id="access-to-and-accuracy-of-member-information">Access to and Accuracy of Member Information</h3>
			<p>The Operators make every effort to protect personal information supplied by users of the web site, including using firewalls and other security measures on their servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any web site, including this one. The Operators assume no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when you access this web site and provide personal information.</p>
			<h3 id="opting-out">Opting Out</h3>
			<p>From time to time the Operators may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.</p>
			<p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, please <a href="/community/">contact us</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="trademark-policy">Trademark Policy</h2>
			<h3 id="trademarks-owned-by-iocage">Trademarks owned by iocage</h3>
			<p>This is a current listing of United States trademarks owned by iocage, Inc. (“iocage”) and might also be trademarks or registered trademarks in other countries. Please note that laws concerning use and marking of trademarks or product names vary by country. Always consult a local attorney for additional guidance. Not all common law marks used by iocage are listed on this page. Because of the large number of products marketed by iocage, iocage’s practice is to list only the most important of its common law marks. Failure of a mark to appear on this page does not mean that iocage does not use the mark nor does it mean that the product is not actively marketed or is not significant within its relevant market.</p>
			<p>Those trademarks followed by ® are registered trademarks of iocage in the United States; those followed by ™ are trademarks or common law marks of iocage in the United States.</p>
			<p>This list is not a comprehensive list of all iocage trademarks.</p>
			<p>This list is updated as of October 10th, 2017</p>
			<p>Iocage™</p>
			<p><img src="/img/iocage_logo.png" alt="Iocage™ Logo" /></p>
			<h3 id="fair-use-of-iocage-trademarks">Fair use of iocage Trademarks</h3>
			<p>“Fair use” of iocage trademarks (use by a third party without express permission or license) is limited to text-only references to iocage trademarks, such as product and service names, and excludes iocage logos.</p>
			<p>In such references, you must be truthful, must not disparage iocage, and must not mislead the public. You must be clear and accurate as to the nature of the relationship between iocage and your company, its products, and its services.</p>
			<p>The following is an example of fair use:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When you are indicating that iocage is compatible with another product. For example: a) XYZ is compatible with iocage.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Please note that the emphasis should be on your product name and any accompanying packaging produced by your company. Labeling should place emphasis on your product name so that it is perceived as an application, developed with, compatible with, or running on an iocage product.</p>
			<h3 id="special-attributions">Special attributions</h3>
			<p>The mark FreeBSD is a registered trademark of the FreeBSD Foundation and is used by iocage with the permission of the FreeBSD Foundation.</p>
			<p>Plex, the Plex Play logo and Plex Media Server are trademarks of Plex and used under a license to iocage.</p>
